# ⚔️ Zoro - Borked UI Jam Entry

> *"Nothing happened..."* — Roronoa Zoro

A **"Borked UI"** experience featuring Roronoa Zoro from *One Piece*. This interface looks like a standard challenge modal... until you try to use it. The UI is literally sliced apart using CSS `clip-path` animations and physics simulations.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Enter your name** (or a specific character name).
2. Click **CHALLENGE**.
3. Watch the interface get destroyed by **Santoryu** (Three Sword Style).

## ✨ Features
* **Destructive UI:** The dialog box is sliced into 4 separate pieces that fly apart with physics-based animations.
* **Lore Accurate Failures:** Includes a mechanic where Zoro "gets lost" and runs in the wrong direction, failing to execute the command.
* **Cinematic Effects:** Screen shake, impact flashes, and "Haki" pressure (screen dimming).
* **Audio Sync:** Voice lines, slash SFX, and sheath clicks are perfectly timed to the visual animation.
* **Custom Cursor:** Features Zoro's legendary blade, *Shusui*.
* **Mobile Responsive:** The cutting logic calculates dynamic coordinates, ensuring the slice looks perfect on both desktop and mobile.

## 🏴‍☠️ Secrets & Easter Eggs (For Judges)
Since this is a Borked UI Jam, the "errors" are part of the fun. Try typing these specific names to trigger unique interactions:

| Input | Effect | Lore Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Sanji"** or **"Cook"** | **Instant Attack** (No voice delay) | Zoro hates the cook; he doesn't hesitate. |
| **"Kuina"** | **Attack Canceled** | He made a promise to her. |
| **"Mihawk"** | **Attack Canceled** | He admits he is not strong enough yet. |
| **"Lost"** | **Zoro runs the wrong way** | Triggers his famous lack of direction (usually a 10% RNG chance). |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
* **CSS3**: `clip-path` for slicing, `@keyframes` for animations, and `flexbox` for layout.
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, Audio API, and dynamic coordinate calculation for the slice effect.
* **No Frameworks**: 100% pure, lightweight code.

## 🚀 Installation / Usage
No build step is required.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Turn up your volume! 🔊
